"""Swappable trial-data writer: the framework owns the durable write, the task emits dicts.

``TrialDataWriter`` is the seam the task-isolation work writes through - a task calls
``emit_trial(dict)`` and the framework persists it via the injected writer, instead of the task
calling ``save_trial_data`` itself. ``JsonlTrialDataWriter`` is the first, behaviour-preserving
implementation: it keeps the accumulated trials and rewrites the JSONL through ``save_trial_data``
on every write, so the bytes on disk are identical to a direct save. A future append-mode writer can
be swapped in without touching tasks. Lives beside the JSONL codec it wraps.
